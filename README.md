# After Running ```python main.py``` command in Termux 
  
• Click 1 : Put Your Mobile No. , Subscriber ID or Password for first time . <br>
OR<br>
• Click 2 : Put Your Mobile No. , Subscriber ID or OTP for first time . <br>
After Doing Any of Above 1 or 2 .Then Click 3 .<br>
• Click 3 : Generate PlayLists Every 24hrs .  <br><br>

• You Get Your PlayLists under ```DCIM/Sneh-TataSky-Termux/Sneh-TataSky``` Folder of Internal Storage . <br>
• Just Import m3u PlayLists in Tivimate or IPTV Smarter Pro & Enjoy . <br>
• Click On Channel and Play <br>

# Method 2 with App (Easy)
<hr>

- You can simply use the android app in your mobile phone or TV, login and then generate an m3u
- The app can be found [here](https://github.com/techiesneh/Sneh-TataSky/blob/main/static/app.apk?raw=true)
- Note that you have to generate a new playlist before the exploit time, that is mentioned in the app, or just one day for simplicity
- The app can smartly detect if you have a playlist already in the mentioned directory,(the location of the file can be found inside the app), and it overwrites the content if you generate it again and again
- You can point Tivimate to the location mentioned in the app, and just update once whenever you want to watch the playlist, should work fine
- **There may be issues navigating through the textfields in TV, Try with the left key to navigate down, works for me, will fix, when I have time**
- Minimum Supported Version : Android 5.0

# Good points to know

+ You must have basic knowledge of how to run scripts using python
+ You **CANNOT** have the channels, which you have not subscribed in the generated playlist
+ The generated m3u file **has to be updated daily**.
  If you generated it at 11:00pm today it will expire by 11:00pm tomorrow.
  **You don't need to relogin**, just generate the playlist again using command number 3 in the script.

# Playing in Android TV

+ You can use Kodi with the PVR Simple IPTV Plugin [doesn't work yet]. The generated m3u file already is in the standard format that can be read by the plugin (WIP)
+ You can use Tivimate app to play the m3u playlist too

# Playing in Android 
+ You can use Kodi to play the m3u file(WIP)
+ You can play individual channel using [Exostreamer](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mtdeer.exostreamr) 
See the below section on `Getting hold of individual channels` to know how to get the link to play a specific channel as you cannot play the entire playlist
+ Paste the channel url first and then click on the DRM button to enter the license url and then click on play

# Playing in a browser (tried with Chrome)

+ I personally use [Native MPEG-Dash + HLS Playback](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/native-mpeg-dash-%20-hls-pl/cjfbmleiaobegagekpmlhmaadepdeedn) which doesn't suppport playlists yet

See the below section on `Getting hold of individual channels` to know how to get the link to play a specific channel as you cannot play the entire playlist
+ Get the channel url (ends with ```.mpd```) and paste it in the browser
+ The extension automatically asks for the license url. You should then input the  license url.
